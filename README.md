A bunch of stuff I do in my free time when I'm bored, or if I get an idea, or etc. All of these "reinvent the wheel," that is, they've been done before. It's more for personal coding experience, and time wasting.

### Descriptions:
- [A* Pathfinding Algorithm](Coding%20Projects/AStarPath)
 - I'd seen this a bunch on YouTube. It was interesting so I did it too. Draw a maze by left-click-dragging. Erase with the right side.  
- [Flappy Bird](Coding%20Projects/FlappyBird)
  - Obviously poor quality, but while my dad and brother watched James Bond downstairs, I gave this a shot. Are there two files? Yes. I forget the difference (i.e., too lazy to test both).
- [Base 10 Converter](Coding%20Projects/BaseConvert.py)
  - One of my classmates made this and I thought there might be a way to shorten it. Here's my version.
- [Demotivational Posters](Miscellaneous/DEmotivation.pptx)
  - I made this back when I had Chem/AP Chem. My teacher enjoyed posters like these.
- [House Loans Calculator](Coding%20Projects/HouseLoans.py)
  - We were supposed to do this on a TI-84 calculator, but I chose Python instead. This was for a VVV/Diff-EQ post-AP project.
- [HTML Background Changer](Miscellaneous/backgroundchange.html)
  - A venturing into Javascript. Webpages are *hard* to do! So, there's a button. And the background changes.
- [Reduced Row-Echelon Form Calculator](Coding%20Projects/rrefCalc.py)
  - I got annoyed with all the versions on the Internet, ads and poor design and such, so when I had time, I made my own. I think it breaks sometimes. Hmm... better check up on that. Also, the rref portion is actually stripped directly from the Internet. I'll write my own within a year.
- [Modulo Geometric Art](Coding%20Projects/shapesMultMod.py)
  - After watching a Mathologer video on how connecting lines between *i* and *n\*i* for *n* constant and increasing *i*, which was just equally spaced points around a circle, created a cardioid, I made a program for it.
- [Sierpinski Triangle from Random Point](Coding%20Projects/sierpinskiChaos.py)
  - This also came from a YouTube video. Choose a point inside a triangle. Forever get the midpoint between that point and a random vertex, then set new midpoint as next basis for following midpoint, etc.
- [Snake](Coding%20Projects/snake.py)
  - From the good 'ol Intro to Programming days. My version will break if you press arrows too quickly: the snake turns in on itself. The game may also get ridiculously slow later.
- [README.md](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
  - A recursive link[.](README.md)
  - The period. Wink wink.
